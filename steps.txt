1) make api handling then listen it on a port using app.listen;
2) we are creating .env file so that all our confidential thing should keep private in a file it could be port, password etc.
  also we have to install package from the npm for env. + install package morgan (what morgan acutally do is it tells you what was the 
  response from the server it was 200/ok or 304.)
3) I saw how do we use the .env file in our server file first we define something confidential in our .env file then we use that 
  .env file in our file as import dotenv from "dotenv", then dotenv.config()= as our env file is in root directory we don't have 
  to define any other path if it is present in other path what we will do is dotenv.config([path:"/env"]);
4) I saw how to use mongodb database via online. We have to create cluster with different name then we have to assign the whitelist
   ip adress and then create new database connect the online database to compass to offline and copy the url there in password write 
   password and user name net/{nameof database}
5)In env file make a variable as MONGO_URL where you will initiate the file url which you copied from the online mongodb and write 
  password and userName here;
6) make a file named as db.js in new config directory where we will be importing the mongoose here: import mongoose, connectDb=try,catch
   for try mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URL);
7) Now in server.js import morgan and use middlewares as app.use(express.json()) and app.use(morgan('dev'))
   and connect mongoDb with the name you initiated in db.js
8) Create few folder named as controllers,helpers,middlewares,models,routes: 
      a) models: in this dir create mongoose schema files;
      b) controllers: in this dir create 
      c) helpers: in this dir create utility files such as password hashing file, here we are using the bcrypt encryption package to 
         encrypt the password;
      d)
